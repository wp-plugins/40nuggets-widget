== Frequently asked questions ==

= Does 40Nuggets replace my existing email newsletter program? =

40Nuggets can replace your existing eNewsletter program. 40Nuggets is mainly focused on delivering the right nuggets of content to each unique user, rather than simply communicating news. That said, you may also use it for a news update as well. And if you choose you can keep your old Newsletter system for your occasional news updates, and let 40Nuggets work your content for you in the meantime.

= Can I control the timing of my nuggets? =

Absolutely. 40Nuggets is becoming evermore adaptive; soon it will analyze when each unique user prefers to have mail delivered and the program will adapt to deliver your nuggets then. This will be a nice advantage for you should you choose to take advantage of it. That said, you will always have control over the timing of your mailings.

= Can I edit nuggets? =

Yes!

= How much does 40Nuggets cost? =

40Nuggets is free for up to 100 contacts and 500 Nuggets per month. Beyond that, plan prices range based on how many contacts you are sending to (see our "Get Started" page). The value in 40Nuggets is not only matching and sending the right content to the right users, but saving you lots of time creating content. To help you in this we analyze your content and help you pull out the right nuggets for use in your mailings.

= Can I cancel? =

Anytime and with no penalty fee. You pay a monthly fee, and you can say goodbye anytime (though we'll miss you!).

= What statistics can I see? =

We provide you a full overview of how your content is performing with each and every user. You will be able to track delivery numbers, bounce rate, unique open rates, total opens, unique clicks, total clicks. Much more on the way, too.

= How does 40Nuggets match content and users? =

We use a bunch of tools that we've created over time and by analyzing thousands of pieces of content and hundreds of thousands of communications with audience members.

= Does email look like it comes from my own email address? =

Yes, absolutely. Your brand, your heading, your logo. We show you exactly how to do it when you sign up.
